# GraphQL
Graphql is a staticly typed query language for requesting data from a server.

it is a declaritive way of fetching structured data from a server endpoint using http. It's declarative nature allows it to optimise queries straight away by requesting only what is needed, no more, no less. This prevents unnessecery fething when requesting data.

There are three parts to a graphql schema
- queries
- mutations
- subscriptions

each of these has a unique function for handling the fetching and manipulation of data
