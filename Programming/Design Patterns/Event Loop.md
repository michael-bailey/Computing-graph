# Event Loops
An event loop is a design pattern that is composed of a queue; that holds events, and dispatches them to whereever they are needed.

This is a common way to implement asynchronous programming; for instance javascript uses an event loop, as it can implement a form of cooperative multitasking where it shares execution time of tis thread between different peices of code.
